# google-font

A web component for loading fonts from Google Fonts.

> [!NOTE]
> This is _not_ the best way to load fonts. It's fun to mess around with though, and could be maybe useful if you're building an editor that pulls in fonts from Google Fonts to easily let users try things out quickly and easily. Or maybe you just want to easily pepper in some special fonts in a blog post or something.
